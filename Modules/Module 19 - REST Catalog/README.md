## Module 19 - Iceberg REST Catalog

## Use 3rd Party Clients to access data in Cloudera

This module demonstrates using various 3rd party Iceberg REST enabled clients to access data that is "managed" (loaded & processed using CDW, CDE, CDF, and/or DataHub) by Cloudera.

**3rd Party Client Access:**

The example provides code/sql to use to connect various clients to the Cloudera Iceberg REST Catalog.  Each example provides the following:

- Establish connectivity to the REST Endpoint.
- How to obtain the Crdential to be used 
- Code/sql to query the data from Cloudera.
- SQL to load more data in Cloudera.
- Execute the same code/sql to show the automatic update of the Metadata location pointer.

Remember to replace `${prefix}` with your actual user ID throughout the process.
