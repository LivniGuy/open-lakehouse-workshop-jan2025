#  MODULE 02 - Creating Tables

## Creating Iceberg Tables Using SQL, Spark SQL and Spark DataFrames

This module covers creating Iceberg tables on the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) using three methods: SQL, Spark SQL, and Spark DataFrames. Iceberg tables offer advantages like efficient data management and schema evolution.

**1\. Creating Iceberg Tables using SQL:**

This method leverages SQL commands to define the table schema, data storage format (Parquet in this example), and partitioning scheme. The example demonstrates creating a partitioned Iceberg table named `flights` with relevant columns and partitioning by year.

**2\. Creating Iceberg Tables using Spark SQL**

Spark SQL provides another approach to defining Iceberg tables programmatically within Spark applications.

**3\. Creating Iceberg Tables using Spark DataFrames**

Spark DataFrames offer a programmatic way to create Iceberg tables within Spark environments.

This module provides a foundation for creating Iceberg tables suited for your specific needs on CDP. By following along in this module, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of creating and populating Iceberg tables on CDP.

Remember to replace `${user_id}` with your actual user ID throughout the process.
